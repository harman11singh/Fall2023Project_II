## Premiere League Insights using R
The dataset is based on the Premier League statistics for London teams which are Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, West Ham, Crystal Palace and Brentford from the season 2021/2022.
The main objective is to find which players are the best attacker, midfielder and defender in all the London teams and overall finding the best London team of the season 2021/2022 using various data manipulative libraries (such as dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse),  code and techniques taught in this course and present the findings through different data visualizations.
